# katlas-ai-a2a
KATLAS provides self-sovereign context and cryptographically attested AI decision proofs for humans, IoT and autonomous agents. Mobile AI agents travel to wallets for verification, while a consensus mesh timestamps only bilateral transaction proofs. Privacy-native, model-neutral, deployable orchestration.
KATLAS — Bilateral AI Decision Attestation & Agent Orchestration

KATLAS is a self-sovereign trust fabric for coordinating humans, IoT devices, robots and mobile AI agents through verifiable, privacy-preserving decision attestations, without centralising or replicating sensitive data.

The core gap today

Independent systems don’t trust each other at handoff.

AI decisions lack an underwritten, verifiable proof layer.

Context quality is noisy, unstructured, and costly to reason on at scale.

How KATLAS works

Each role controls its own wallet/enclave and signs events at source.

Mobile AI agents travel to wallet data for verification using zero-knowledge or federated disclosure (raw data never leaves the enclave).

A consensus/validation mesh timestamps only bilateral transaction proofs between identities — any mesh or chain can validate, private data is never stored on-chain.

Decisions return to wallets as cryptographically attested proofs, enabling audit, indemnification, and insurable triggers.

Horizontal journeys KATLAS unifies

Traveller / Service Journey

Attest account state, rights, exceptions, and AI decision outcomes for gig, retail, pharmacy and ecommerce actors.

Freight / Container Journey (FreightCierge)

Use containers as trust anchors to prove role-to-role handoffs across vessel, terminal, port, and road participants.

Code / Development QA Journey (dtool/devtool CI/CD)

Attest QA status, reproducible CI/CD results, deployment readiness and exceptions across test and production environments.

Why this matters now

AI is becoming a liability surface across trade, health, autonomy and code integrity.

Edge-context filtering + bilateral attestations reduce cloud inference noise and energy demand.

Markets need deployable trust that is privacy-native, model-neutral, and enterprise-calm.

Complement, don’t compete

KATLAS amplifies large reasoning models (OpenAI, Azure, AWS, GCP) by:

Signed wallet context → Cloud reasoning on distilled need → Timestamped attestation proofs → Returned to wallets for audit or indemnifiable workflows.

KATLAS is a fabric, not a coin.
A trust primitive, not a product.
